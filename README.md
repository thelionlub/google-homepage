This is my first project with "theodinproject." Here goes nothing. 
I'm figuring out how to add things slowly. It's all so confusing. 
Watched a video on someone else doing the project. I approached this from a bad angle. I'm going to start over.
One of my biggest problems was trying to make a flexbox do what I wanted a grid element to do.
