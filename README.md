This is my first project with "theodinproject." Here goes nothing. 
I'm figuring out how to add things slowly. It's all so confusing. 
Watched a video on someone else doing the project. I approached this from a bad angle. I'm going to start over.
One of my biggest problems was trying to make a flexbox do what I wanted a grid element to do. 
I tried watching another youtuber do this project and the way they were doing was just too much. I'm going to start again once i've watched a few people do it, and then just take it slowly one element at a time.
